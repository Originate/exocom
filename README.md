ExoCom is a modern message bus for AI-native application ecosystems.
This monorepository contains the different subprojects for it:

* __exocom-server:__ the actual bus implementation
* __exocom-mock-*:__ mock implementations of the ExoCom server
                     for testing
* __exorelay-*:__ client SDKs for writing services that talk to ExoCom
* __exoservice-*:__ full-stack frameworks
                    for writing micro-services
                    as pure business logic,
                    i.e. as _lambda functions_
